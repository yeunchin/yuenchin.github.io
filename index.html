    <h2>Analysis I: The Relationship Between Publication Time & Traffic Peaks</h2>
    <p>Understanding <b>when</b> to publish is fundamental. My analysis dissects the interplay between your posting schedule and the subsequent emergence of peak readership.</p>
    
    <div class="chart-container">
        <h3>Insight 1.1: Publication & Peak Time Correlation</h3>
        <p>The heatmap below visualizes the relationship between the hour an article is published (Y-axis) and the hour its traffic peaks on the same day (X-axis). The intensity of the color indicates the frequency of this pairing. A strong cluster emerges for articles published between <b>16:00 and 18:00</b>, which consistently generate traffic peaks later in the evening, primarily between <b>20:00 and 22:00</b>.</p>
        <div id="fig1_1"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
        <h3>Insight 1.2: Publication Slot Performance</h3>
        <p>A box plot provides a more statistically robust view, showing the median, spread, and outliers. The <b>Afternoon (12:00-17:00)</b> slot demonstrates the highest potential, containing the articles with the absolute highest peak traffic.</p>
        <div id="fig1_2"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
        <h3>Insight 1.3: The "Time to Peak" Efficiency</h3>
        <p>This histogram shows the distribution of time elapsed (in hours) from publication to the day's traffic peak. The majority of articles reach their peak within <b>1 to 4 hours</b> of publication, representing your most typical "ignition" cycle.</p>
        <div id="fig1_3"></div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Analysis II: The Relationship Between Article Type & Traffic Performance</h2>
    <p>Beyond timing, the <b>content itself</b> is the primary driver of engagement. By categorizing articles based on their titles, we can uncover which strategic themes resonate most powerfully with your audience.</p>

    <div class="chart-container">
        <h3>Insight 2.1: Performance by Content Category</h3>
        <p><b>Corporate/Brand Announcements</b> and <b>Major Collaborations</b> are in a class of their own, consistently achieving the highest traffic. <b>Community/Lifestyle Events</b> form a stable mid-tier.</p>
        <div id="fig2_1"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
        <h3>Insight 2.2: The Lifecycle & Decay of Traffic</h3>
        <p>This chart illustrates the average traffic peak decay. Note the <b>Critical Anomaly</b>: in several key instances, the Day 1 traffic peak surpassed the Day 0 peak. This suggests a "fermentation period" for high-impact content.</p>
        <div id="fig2_2"></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Data-Driven Strategic Recommendations</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Adopt a "Prime Time" Publishing Strategy:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Window (High-Impact Content):</strong> Reserve your most important announcements for the <b>16:00 - 18:00</b> window to capitalize on the afternoon slot's high potential and align with the proven evening consumption peak (20:00-22:00).</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary Window (Routine Content):</strong> For regular updates, a <b>11:00 - 12:00</b> publication can be effective for the lunchtime audience. Avoid early morning posts.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Optimize Your Content Matrix Based on Performance:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Double Down on Winners:</strong> Acknowledge that <b>Corporate/Brand</b> stories are your primary traffic drivers. Allocate premium resources to these announcements.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultivate Your Base:</strong> Maintain a steady cadence of <b>Community/Lifestyle</b> content to build audience loyalty and maintain baseline engagement.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Implement a "Second Wave" Promotion Tactic:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Actively monitor articles for the "Day 1 > Day 0" phenomenon. When a high-impact article is published, plan for a <b>Day 1 promotional push</b> to capture the "fermentation" effect and maximize its lifecycle.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
